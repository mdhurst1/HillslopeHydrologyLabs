    "# Introduction to Numerical Modelling for Water Systems\n",

    "In this lab you will write a simple model for how water infiltrates a porous soil column to replenish soil water storage. These exercises are intentionally simple, aiming to build up your conceptual understanding of how mathematical models can be developed and applied to environmental systems. The principles and concepts you will learn underlie most numerical models of water systems and are thus broadly applicable, rather than specific to the idealised system you will simulate in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of this lab are to:\n",
    "* Understand how a numerical model is constructed \n",
    "* Implement mathematical equations to describe how stored water volume changes through time\n",
    "* Understand the importance of initial conditions in mathematical modelling\n",
    "* Create and explain graphs/figures that visualise model behaviour\n",
    "* Experiment with the model to understand its sensitivity to different parameters\n",
    "* Understand the concepts of transient evolution and steady-state dynamic equilibrium\n",
    "* Explore the concepts of model calibration and verification\n",

    "Learning to program is not the main aim but we want you to see what's \"under the hood\" of simple models to help you understand how they are built and what they can and cannot do! However, scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is highly versatile, for example it can interface with GIS to automate workflows, or it is used in many data analysis and machine learning applications.\n",

    "If you compare the RMS errors of the two time stepping schemes, it is easy to see quite how much better the second-order scheme performs. It doesn't only have more than one order of magnitude lower error at the largest time step (blue dot), but also reduces by a factor 4 in error for every factor 2 refinement of time step. \n",
