    "# Introduction to Numerical Modelling for Water Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will write a simple model for how water infiltrates a porous soil column to replenish soil water storage. These exercises are intentionally simple, aiming to build up your conceptual understanding of how mathematical models can be developed and applied to environmental systems. The principles and concepts you will learn underlie most numerical models of water systems and are thus broadly applicable, rather than specific to the idealised system you will simulate in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of this lab are to:\n",
    "* Understand how a numerical model is constructed \n",
    "* Implement mathematical equations to describe how stored water volume changes through time\n",
    "* Understand the importance of initial and boundary conditions in mathematical modelling\n",
    "* Create and explain graphs/figures that visualise model behaviour\n",
    "* Experiment with the model to understand its sensitivity to different parameters\n",
    "* Understand the concepts of transient evolution and steady-state dynamic equilibrium\n",
    "* Explore the concepts of model calibration and verification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "The model is written in the Python computer programming language. But don't worry, you won't need any prior knowledge of computer programming. We have set up this lab so it will also serve as a basic introduction to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program is not the main aim but we want you to see what's \"under the hood\" of simple models to help you understand how they are built and what they can and cannot do! However, scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is highly versatile, for example it can interface with GIS to automate workflows, or it is used in many data analysis and machine learning applications.\n",

    "## 3.0 2-D soil water infiltration model\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will extend the 1-D column model of soil water infiltration from the previous Lab to two dimensions. The model will represent a vertical cross-section through the soil profile down a hillslope. The model domain extends from the surface exposed to water influx by precipitation to the base where water outflux into an aquifer below occurs. The model will follow a modified version of Richards Equation, which in addition to vertical segregation of water into unsaturated soil will also comprise downslope water percolation due to a topographic gradient in hydraulic head. To keep things simple we will assume that the topographic slope has a uniform angle, $\\phi$, from the horizontal and that the model domain is positioned such that the horizontal coordinate points downhill along the surface while the vertical coordinate points downwards into the soil column perpendicular to the surface (see conceptual model sketch).\n",
    "\n",
    "To discretise the model we divide up the soil cross-section into discrete volume elements. The model will track the water content in each of these grid cells and compute the fluxes of water that flow across the faces between them. We will define the boundary conditions such that water is added along the top boundary by precipition, that unhindered flux of water from the base represents groundwater recharge into a bedrock aquifer beneath, and that unhindered in- and outflow on the side boundaries represent flow from upslope and drainage into downslope portions of the hillslope profile. We assume there is no lateral flow of water in or out of the soil column in the third dimension, hence representing a laterally homogeneous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will formulate the model in terms of the relative volume fraction, $\\theta = V_\\mathrm{water}/V_\\mathrm{total}$. Based on the fundamental principle of mass conservation, we can express the governing equation for the evolving water content as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {{\\partial \\theta(\\mathbf{x},t)}\\over{\\partial t}}=-\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}{\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x},t)} \\ , \\tag{1} \\label{eq:1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the change in volume fraction of water in each volume element $\\theta(\\mathbf{x},t)$ $[L^3/L^3 = 1]$ through time $t$ $[T]$ is given by the spatial gradient in volumetric water flux $\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x},t) = [q_x,q_z]$ $[L^3/L^2/T = L/T]$ in both spatial directions, $\\mathbf{x} = [x,z]$ $[L]$. The gradient operator is a mathematical shorthand for $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} = [\\partial /\\partial x, \\partial/\\partial z]$, the partial derivative in both spatial directions. Note that we are using boldface symbols to indicate variables that are vectors, meaning they have more than one component to account for all spatial dimensions in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation \\eqref{eq:1} states that if there is a change in the flux of water in space, $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} q$, this has to be balanced by a change in soil water content $\\theta$ in time. If more water flows into a volume element than flows out within a given time interval the stored amount in the local volume will increase, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For saturated soil, Darcy's law can be used to describe the water flux $q$ $[L/T]$ as the product of the hydraulic conductivity $K$ $[L/T]$ and the spatial gradient of the hydraulic head $H(\\mathbf{x},t)$ $[L/L = 1]$,\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hydraulic head only changes with the topographic slope then we can simplify $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} H = [-\\sin(\\varphi),0]$. Note that $\\varphi$ is in units of $[radians]$ here, and the negative sign comes from the hydraulic head _decreasing_ in the x-coordinate direction. In this case, the z-component of the hydraulic gradient is zero since the soil is assumed to already be saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsaturated soil, however, we have seen in the previous Lab that the flow of water is governed by two pressure heads: the buoyancy difference between water and air in the unsaturated pore space, which leads to the denser water percolating down to replace air in the pore space, and capillary effects, which act to suck water into unsaturated pore space to wet soil particles. The latter we again represent by an empirically determined function $h(\\theta)$ (units are $[L]$, as it is also normalised by $\\Delta \\rho g$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In our 2-D model, buoyancy-related hydraulic head no longer acts purely in the vertical direction. This is due to our choice to point the model's x-axis down along the hillslope and the z-axis into the soil column perpendicular to the surface (see Figure above). The total hydraulic head then is a combination of capillary head and buoyancy-related head modified by hillslope topography, $H = h - \\sin(\\varphi) x - \\cos(\\varphi) z$. Note that negative signs again indicate that the head decreases in both coordinate directions. With that, we can use equation \\eqref{eq:2} to write the flux components in x- and z-directions as,\n",

    "Substituting eqs (3) and (4) into the conservation equation (1), and noting that both the hydraulic conductivity $K$ and the capillary head $h$ are themselves empirical functions of the soil water content $\\theta$, we finally write the governing equation for 2D soil water infiltration,\n",

However, the model behaviour isn't really two-dimensional since there isn't yet any variability of model behaviour in the along-slope direction. For the present model scenario, spending the additional conceptual and computational effort is not worth it because the same outcome could be captured by a less conceptually complex and computationally costly 1-D model.\n",

For example, it is common that precipitation is more intense on the windward upper slopes of a ridge of hills, a phenomenon known as orographic precipitation. On the relatively small spatial scales on which our model is built such effects will likely be negligible in natural systems, but for the sake of demonstration we will consider a scenario where precipitation falls predominantly on the uphill portion of the model domain."
