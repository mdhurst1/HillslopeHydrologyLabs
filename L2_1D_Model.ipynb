    "# Introduction to Numerical Modelling for Water Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will write a simple model for how water infiltrates a porous soil column to replenish soil water storage. These exercises are intentionally simple, aiming to build up your conceptual understanding of how mathematical models can be developed and applied to environmental systems. The principles and concepts you will learn underlie most numerical models of water systems and are thus broadly applicable, rather than specific to the idealised system you will simulate in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of this lab are to:\n",
    "* Understand how a numerical model is constructed \n",
    "* Implement mathematical equations to describe how stored water volume changes through time\n",
    "* Understand the importance of initial and boundary conditions in mathematical modelling\n",
    "* Create and explain graphs/figures that visualise model behaviour\n",
    "* Experiment with the model to understand its sensitivity to different parameters\n",
    "* Understand the concepts of transient evolution and steady-state dynamic equilibrium\n",
    "* Explore the concepts of model calibration and verification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "The model is written in the Python computer programming language. But don't worry, you won't need any prior knowledge of computer programming. We have set up this lab so it will also serve as a basic introduction to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program is not the main aim but we want you to see what's \"under the hood\" of simple models to help you understand how they are built and what they can and cannot do! However, scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is highly versatile, for example it can interface with GIS to automate workflows, or it is used in many data analysis and machine learning applications.\n",

If the code fails, try restarting and executing all cells again from the top.* To restart the script click the circular arrow button or select `Kernel / Restart` from the menu bar at the top of the window.\n",

    "## 2.0 1-D column model\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will implement a numerical model solving the Richards Equation (Richards, 1931) for soil water infiltration down a 1-D vertical column. The Richards equation is a so-called partial differential equation (PDE, has derivatives of both time and space) and is based on Darcy's Law. It represents the vertical segregation of water into unsaturated porous soil. Units are expressed as $[L]$ength and $[T]$ime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our starting point is a soil column conceptualised as a vertical 1-D profile into a laterally homogeneous soil horizon from the surface down to bedrock. To discretise the model we split up the soil column into discrete volume elements (like a stack of bathtubs). The model will track the water content in each of these volume cells and compute the flux of water that flows vertically across the faces between them. We will assume that the only input of water is precipition that infiltrates into the soil from above, and the only output is recharge of ground water from water passing out the base and into a bedrock aquifer. Precipitation and recharge are the boundary conditions we will impose on the top and base of our 1-D model domain. We assume there is no lateral flow of water in or out of the soil column, representing a laterally homogeneous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than tracking the absolute volume of water, $V_\\mathrm{water}$, in each volume element, we will consider the relative volume fraction, $\\theta = V_\\mathrm{water}/V_\\mathrm{total}$. Based on the fundamental principle of mass conservation, we can express the governing equation for the evolving water content with depth and time as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    {{\\partial \\theta(z,t)}\\over{\\partial t}}=-{{\\partial q(z,t)}\\over{\\partial z}} \\ , \\tag{1} \\label{eq:1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the change in volume fraction of water in each volume element $\\theta(t,z)$ $[L^3/L^3 = 1]$ through time $t$ $[T]$ is given by the vertical gradient in volumetric water flux $q(z,t)$ $[L^3/L^2/T = L/T]$ with depth $z$ $[L]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equation \\eqref{eq:1} states that if there is a change in the flux of water with depth, $dq/dz$, this has to be balanced by a change in soil water content $\\theta$. If more water arrives in the top of a volume element than leaves out the base, the stored amount in the local volume will increase, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "For saturated soil, Darcy's law can be used to describe the water flux $q$ $[L/T]$ as the product of the hydraulic conductivity $K$ $[L/T]$ and the vertical gradient of the hydraulic head  $dH / dz$ $[L/L = 1]$,\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsaturated soil, however, the flow of water is governed by two pressure heads (i.e., mechanical driving forces). One pressure component is due to the buoyancy difference between water and air that occupies the unsaturated pore space, $\\Delta \\rho g z$, with $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho^\\mathrm{water} - \\rho^\\mathrm{air}$ the density difference, and $g$ the gravity. The buoyancy-related pressure is transformed to a hydraulic head through normalising by the buoyancy force $\\Delta \\rho g$, leaving just $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second pressure component driving flow is due to capillary forces in the unsaturated soil acting to effectively suck water into air-filled pores to wet the surrounding soil particles. The theoretical derivation of that capillary pressure component is somewhat involved; hence, we will represent it with an empirically determined function $h$ (units are $[L]$, as it is also normalised by $\\Delta \\rho g$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The total hydraulic pressure head then is a combination of capillary and buoyancy-related heads, $H=h-z$; note that the negative sign comes from the fact that we have defined the z-axis to point down from the surface into the soil column. With that, we can rewrite equation \\eqref{eq:2} as,\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    q=-K{{\\partial(h+z)}\\over{\\partial z}} = -K\\left({{\\partial h}\\over{\\partial z}}-{{\\partial z}\\over{\\partial z}}\\right) \\ . \\tag{3} \\label{eq:3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ${\\partial z}/{\\partial z} = 1$, we can simplify to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    q=-K\\left({{\\partial h}\\over{\\partial z}}-1\\right) \\ . \\tag{4} \\label{eq:4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting eq. (4) into the conservation equation (1), and noting that both the hydraulic conductivity $K$ and the capillary head $h$ are themselves empirical functions of the soil water content $\\theta$, we finally get to the Richards equation,\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how does the capillary pressure head vary as a function of water content? We would expect capillary suction to vanish as the soil becomes water-saturated, and highest if the soil is nearly dry. An expression for the relationship between water content and pressure due to capillary forces $h$ can be found from rearranging eq. (3) in *van Genuchten* (1980) as,\n",

If you wanted to run the model stably until the wetting front reaches the bedrock you need a time step as small as $10^{-5}$ days, or less than a second!\n",

There is a whole field of research to theoretically determine what discretisation produces stable results for all kinds of physical model equations. If you go and look up \"Richards Equation stability\" online you will find a whole host of research papers dedicated to the question of how to avoid unstable solutions. You find the PDF for one recent review paper on the subject in the folder for this Lab (*Farthing* et al., 2017).\n",

Instead, the flux is itself a non-linear function of the water content, both through the hydraulic conductivity and the capillary head! This non-linearity means that the speed of $q$ doesn't quite limit the rate at which water migrates into the soil column. \n",

An intuitive way to understand how a diffusion process works is to consider the example of heat conduction. For example, if you hold the tip of a cold iron bar into a hot flame it will slowly warm all the way through until it begins to burn your hand. The heat is moving along the iron without the iron itself moving along the bar: that's diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true for how capillary forces act on water content. The water diffuses into the soil, meaning it moves with a different effective rate than suggested by evaluating the flux (like the heat moves along the iron without the iron itself moving at all). Luckily, there is a well known stable time step criterion for diffusive transport, and it depends on the diffusivity, $D$:\n",

We can find that by taking the derivative of eq. (6), but to do that manually is a bit of a hassle. Instead, we can also use Python for this purpose.
